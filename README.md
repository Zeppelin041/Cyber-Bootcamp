Hackbright Academy Cybersecurity Bootcamp

Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects and hands-on experience gained from the Hackbright Academy Cybersecurity Bootcamp, sponsored by Walmart's InfoSec team. This intensive program provided me with a deep dive into cybersecurity principles, practical security tools, and real-world applications in threat detection, risk management, and system recovery.

📌 About This Repository

This repository shows part of my journey through the cybersecurity bootcamp, which includes my capstone project, where I focused on disaster recovery planning within a virtualized environment. It contains documentation, project files, and a video demonstration of the recovery process. Nothing too technical, basically created multiple VMS and a Windows server and demonstrated how deleting files from one computer can be recovered easily with backups in play.

Outside of the project the bootcamp itself covered a wide rang of cybersecurity topics from script, to laws, to policies, and many labs to hone our skills in everything cyber. Infosec worked hand and hand with us to help us broaden our horizons with hands on experience that college somewhat lacked in. Since most of the work was all labs and video meetings, I am only able to share the final capstone that led me to graduation.

🛠️ Key Topics & Skills Gained

🔍 Threat Detection & Response – Gained hands-on experience in network monitoring, SIEM analysis, and intrusion detection.

🛡️ Risk Management & Compliance – Learned how to assess security risks and apply industry frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, CIS Controls).

⚙️ Windows Server Security & Hardening – Configured Active Directory, Group Policies, and access controls for secure system administration.

📜 Incident Response & Forensics – Practiced log analysis, digital forensics, and malware investigation.

💾 Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity – Designed and implemented a disaster recovery plan with backup and restoration strategies.

🏆 Capstone Project: Disaster Recovery Plan

For my final capstone project, I developed a disaster recovery plan using a multi-VM environment with Windows Server. The project demonstrates how to recover critical files after deletion, ensuring business continuity in a real-world scenario.

🖥️ Project Components:

📄 Disaster Recovery Plan Documentation – Outlines the full recovery strategy.

💻 Virtual Machine Setup – Configured multiple VMs simulating a corporate IT environment.

🔄 Backup & Recovery Implementation – Demonstrates automated backup solutions and file restoration.

📹 Video Demonstration – A step-by-step walkthrough of the recovery process in action.
